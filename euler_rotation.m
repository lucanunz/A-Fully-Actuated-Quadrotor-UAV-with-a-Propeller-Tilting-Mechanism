function R = euler_rotation(sequence, angles)
% R = euler_rotation(sequence, angles) takes as inputs:
%   -sequence: a string which specifies the axes along which rotation
%              occurs
%   -angles: The radiants (or symbolics) of the three rotations
% and outputs:
%   -R: The desired rotation
% Euler rotations work about moving-axes
